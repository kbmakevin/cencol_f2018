#week8
slide7
	very quantitative stuff
slide9
slide11
slide14
	resolving dq issues, steps u go thru
slide15
	data steward important role
	dont want multiple srcs of data, know where it is coming from

#week9
	what is data mining
	hard to ask q's on some of these things
slide5 quote
slide7
	drivers of data mining...what things in market made data 
slide8 kind of
slide9 - should know
slide 10 - FOR SURE know whole process, iteratively building the model
slide11 - have to know
slide12 know what CRISP-DM is
slide13-know training validation testing, the differences
slide14-15
slide20-supervised learning
slide22-unsupervised learning no label data/target. just build structure
slide24-what does it stand for, potential question
slide25-types of data
	orinal = categorical with an order, e.g. age
slide26-data binning
slide27
	ordered==ordinal
slide28 - overfitting needs to know what it is, problems associated with it
slide31-very imp, didnt put enough slides for this
	have to figure ways to differeniate dimensionality
slide33-what types of models are there
slide34-didnt go into the typs of models
	no ask about entropy q's, just fyi gain
slide43-confusion matrix 100% question on this, he spent time on it
dependency network no questions - slide 47
no infor gain, no entropy on the test

#week10
slide2-association rules
slide4-need to know how to calculate support and confidence
slide12-one general question on apriori algorithm e.g. what is it used for?
	why is apriori effective b/c it does bottom up, helps us prune tree, etc.
some things are either too complex for us or too hard to ask questions on that's why no q's

#week11
	this is not academic institution, we try to align how to use things in business
		dont really go into theory here.
slide2-predictive models in what areas
slide3
slide4
slide6-memorize this stuff business problem, solution, benefits
slide7-churn is...? benefits? usage?
slide8
slide10
slide12	collaborative filtering;look at ohow ppl make choices in grp and then offer to ppl in similar grps
slide13	find out customes' behavior through their mouse clicks	
slide21	lift chart;	how many ways can u use a model;	if u have 3 models which one do u pick?
	use confusion matrix, and lift chart to predict
slide27	what does lift chart mean
slide31	cost/profit related to lift chart

#week12
	dmx concepts didnt ask too many q's
naive bayes
	know how it is applied
	slide2	characteristics
		sometimes positive, sometimes negative, diff outcomes need to use probability model
	slide1-4
		just know why u want to use sth like this
dmx
	know the two different kinds of commands
	create structures and query them
	two kinds of commands
		ddl and other
	not too many q's here

#week13
not too many q's on time series; hard to make up q's
just know trend-seasonal-cyclic
slide5-9
those 8 slides


every section has different questions
10	tf
10	mcq
5	sa
