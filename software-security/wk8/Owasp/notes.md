security cannot be plugged in after it is finished
	must be incorporated into the app design

validation vs verification testing
	validation
		process checking whether the specification captures the user's needs
	verification
		process checking that the software meets the specification

security
	must be user independent
		including employees, they shouldnt be able to take adv of system for self benefit

data validation strategies
	whitelist
	backlist
	sanitize
	no validation

# SAMM (Software Assurance Maturity Model)
## Understanding the Model
- defines 4 critical business functions
	- each business function defines three security practices
		- each security practice, SAMM defines three maturity levels as objectives

## 1. Governance
- centered on processes and activities related to how an org manages overall software dev activities
	- concerns that impact cross-functional grps invovled in dev + business processes established at the org level

### a. Governance - Strategy & Metrics
- overall strategic direction of the software assurance program and instrumentation of processes and activities to collect metrics about an organization's security posture

### b. Governance - Policy & Compliance
- setting up a security, compliance and audit ctrl framework throughout the org to achieve incr assurance in software under constrctn and in op

### c. Governance - Education & Guidance
- increasing security knowledge amongst personnel in software dev through training and guidance on security topics relevant to individual job funcs

## 2. Construction
- processes and activities related to how an org defines goals and creates software within dev projects
	- includes product management, req gathering, high-level architecture spcftn, detailed design, and implementation

### a. Construction - Threat Assessment
- accurately identifying and characterizing potential atks upon an org's software in order to better understand the risks and facilitate risk mngmnt

### b. Construction - Security Requirements
- promoting inlcusion of security-related reqs during software dev process in order to spcfy correct functionality from inception

### c. Construction - Secure Architecture
- bolstering design process with activities to promote secure-by-defauly designs and ctrl over techs and framewrks upon which software is built

## 3. Verification
- focused on the process and activities related to how an org checks, and tests artifacts produced throughout
