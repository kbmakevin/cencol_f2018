#Brief summary of our final project
For our final project we have set out to accomplish the goals of:
1. Learning the Bayesian Theorem
2. Applying the Bayesian Theorem in a Machine Learning contextual environment
3. Developing a Hands on Project to demo to the class

#Team member's responsiblities:
As the concepts of Machine Learning is completely new to us and our journey to becoming Bayesian Theorists is just beginning, we are currently in the research and investigation phase of our project:

##Everyone is tasked with:
- reseach bayesian theorem, so that we will have overall understanding of how the things will work in this project

##Team's Future Agenda:
- find dataset and possibly cleanse the data
- finding functions describing the probability of belonging to a class given features
- implement a classifier in Python Programming Language
- develop web interface to demonstrate this
- create simple hands-on example that can be followed along with class
- create presentation slides

#Current Team Performance Grade
Joseph-10
Poulad-10
Mammunur-10
Kevin-10

So far, everyone has been very cooperative and have been demonstrating high performance in their assigned tasks.

#Schedule for finishing project
##Week10
- find dataset and possibly cleanse the data
- finding functions describing the probability of belonging to a class given features

##Week11
- implement a classifier in Python Programming Language
- develop web interface to demonstrate this

##Week12
- create simple hands-on example that can be followed along with class
- create presentation slides

##Week13
- Extra week for flexibility
	- this is scheduled as things which we cannot calculate occur. It is better to have extra freedom than not in our schedule
	- we should be like water.
